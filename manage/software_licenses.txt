The FlexSEA-Manage project was started using examples published by STMicroelectronics, code generated by the Cube tool, and base files from the GNU ARM Eclipse project. Add to that many code examples found online. When using the whole files I kept the original headers. However, it's harder to keep them and offer clean code when I'm copying and pasting single functions in the middle of other code I wrote. This document has a copy of the licences, and some links.

The middleware and system directories are part of the STM Cube ecosystem.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
