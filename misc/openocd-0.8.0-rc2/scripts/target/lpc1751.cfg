# NXP LPC1751 Cortex-M3 with 32kB Flash and 8kB Local On-Chip SRAM,
set CHIPNAME lpc1751
set CPUTAPID 0x4ba00477
set CPURAMSIZE 0x2000
set CPUROMSIZE 0x8000

# After reset the chip is clocked by the ~4MHz internal RC oscillator.
# When board-specific code (reset-init handler or device firmware)
# configures another oscillator and/or PLL0, set CCLK to match; if
# you don't, then flash erase and write operations may misbehave.
# (The ROM code doing those updates cares about core clock speed...)
#
# CCLK is the core clock frequency in KHz
set CCLK 4000

#Include the main configuration file.
